# quantum-dynamic-programming

### Goal
To implement algorithms that demonstrate a quantum speedup on dynamic-programming solutions to certain problems.

### Background
The problems that will be taken up are - 
1. Path in the hypercube
2. Vertex ordering problems
3. Graph bandwidth
4. Travelling salesman problem
5. Feedback arc set
6. Minimum set cover

The quantum algorithms will precompute solutions for a part of the subsets using DP, and then use Grover's search on the remaining subsets to find the solution to the problem.
